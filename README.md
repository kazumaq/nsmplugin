# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

- This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
- `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
  - The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesn’t yet need to load the plugin.
- `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command.
  - The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.
  - We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.

## Get up and running straight away

- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Hello World`.
- Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
- Find output from your extension in the debug console.

## Make changes

- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
- You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Explore the API

- You can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.

## Run tests

- Open the debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) and from the launch configuration dropdown pick `Extension Tests`.
- Press `F5` to run the tests in a new window with your extension loaded.
- See the output of the test result in the debug console.
- Make changes to `src/test/suite/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test/suite` folder.
  - The provided test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`.
  - You can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure your tests any way you want.

- Reduce the extension size and improve the startup time by [bundling your extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension).
- [Publish your extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) on the VS Code extension marketplace.
- Automate builds by setting up [Continuous Integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration).

# nsmplugin README

This is the README for your extension "nsmplugin". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
- `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of ...

### 1.0.1

Fixed issue #.

### 1.1.0

Added features X, Y, and Z.

## Following extension guidelines

Ensure that you've read through the extensions guidelines and follow the best practices for creating your extension.

## Working with Markdown

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

- Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
- Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
- Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.

### Releasing a New Version of the NSMPlugin VS Code Extension

This guide will walk you through the steps to release a new version of the NSMPlugin extension for Visual Studio Code.

#### Step 1: Update your code

Make sure all the changes you want to include in the release are merged into the `main` branch. Resolve any issues or bugs that have been reported and ensure your code is ready for the release.

#### Step 2: Run the release script

Now, you will use the release script to bump the version number and create a new GitHub release. Here is how to do it:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the NSMPlugin project.
3. Run the release script, replacing `vX.Y.Z` with your version:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z
   ```

This will automatically update the version in all `package.json` files, commit these changes to git, push the changes to the remote repository, create a new git tag, push this tag to the remote repository, and create a new release on GitHub.

#### Step 3: Package your extension

After your code updates are committed and pushed, you're ready to package your extension. Run the `vsce package` command to create a VSIX file, which is the packaged extension.

```bash
vsce package
```

This will create a `.vsix` file in your project directory with a name like `nsmplugin-X.Y.Z.vsix`, where `X.Y.Z` is the new version number.

#### Step 4: Upload the VSIX file to the Visual Studio Marketplace

Finally, upload the VSIX file to the Visual Studio Marketplace.

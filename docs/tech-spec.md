# Extensible VSCode Plugin for Natural Semantic Metalanguage Syntax Analysis

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive VSCode plugin that provides robust support for Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) syntax in text files with the .nsm extension. The plugin will focus on enhancing the user experience when working with NSM texts by offering several key features, such as error detection, error highlighting, suggestions for fixes, and multilingual support. The plugin will be designed with extensibility in mind, enabling users to define language-specific settings and molecule definitions in configuration files, and allowing for future support of additional languages.
   The plugin will integrate seamlessly with the VSCode IntelliSense system to offer autocompletion suggestions for NSM primes, molecules, and auxiliary words, thereby improving the efficiency of writing NSM text. A built-in documentation viewer will be included to provide users with easy access to NSM concepts, syntax rules, and language-specific information, making the learning process more convenient and engaging.
   By developing this plugin, we aim to create a valuable tool for researchers, linguists, and other professionals who work with NSM, empowering them to write, analyze, and understand NSM texts more effectively. With its focus on multilingual support, the plugin will also promote cross-cultural understanding and enable users to explore the intricacies of different languages through the lens of NSM.
   In summary, the VSCode plugin for NSM syntax support will offer the following key features:
- Error detection and highlighting for invalid words or undefined molecules in NSM syntax
- Multilingual support with easy extensibility to additional languages
- Seamless integration with the VSCode IntelliSense system for autocompletion suggestions
- Configuration files for managing syntax and language settings
- Suggestions for fixing syntax errors
- A built-in documentation viewer for easy access to NSM concepts and syntax rules
- An extensible and modular design, allowing for future expansion and additional features

## Requirements

- Detect invalid words or undefined molecules in NSM syntax
- Support multiple languages and easy extensibility to other languages
- Integrate with the VSCode IntelliSense system for autocompletion suggestions
- Configuration files for syntax and language settings
- Error highlighting and suggestions for fixes
- Built-in documentation viewer for quick access to NSM concepts and syntax rules

## Implementation Steps

1. Define the vocabulary, including NSM primes and auxiliary words, for each supported language in the configuration files.
1. Create a formal grammar specifying how the words can be combined in the NSM syntax.
1. Implement a parser using a suitable parsing algorithm to process input sentences based on the grammar rules.
1. Develop the plugin to detect errors and provide feedback to the user on violations of grammar rules or the use of disallowed words.
1. Extend the vocabulary and grammar rules to include language-specific molecules.
1. Implement multilingual support by allowing users to define language-specific settings and molecule definitions in the configuration files.
1. Integrate the plugin with the VSCode IntelliSense system to provide autocompletion suggestions for NSM primes, molecules, and auxiliary words.
1. Include a built-in documentation viewer that provides users with quick access to NSM concepts, syntax rules, and language-specific information.
1. Test the plugin with various NSM text files and languages to ensure proper functionality and error detection.
1. Package the plugin for distribution and installation in VSCode.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python for plugin development
- Language Server Protocol (LSP) for integration with VSCode
- Parsing libraries, such as Lark or NLTK, for implementing the parser
- VSCode extension API for creating the plugin and integrating with the editor

## Future Extensions

- Support for additional languages and cultures
- Integration with other editors or IDEs
- Advanced features, such as syntax-aware search, navigation, and refactoring tools

This tech-spec provides an overview of the project, its requirements, implementation steps, tools and libraries, and possible future extensions. It can serve as a starting point for the development of the NSM syntax support plugin for VSCode.
